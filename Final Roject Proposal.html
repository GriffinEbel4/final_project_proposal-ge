<center><H1> Griffins Pygame Game: Name will be decided later</H1></center>
<center><p>Team Members: Griffin Ebel</p></center>
<center><p>As of right right, I will be using Python along with the PyGames library for my final project</p></center>
<center><H3> Proposal Updated: 11/6/21</H3></center>
<center><H1>Overview</H1></center>
<center><p> For my final project I am envisioning a minimal 2d survival game. The player will be faced with an unlimited ammount of enemies that will respawn forever. It will be the players goals to eloimate them before they make contact as that will signal the end of the game. Each eliminated enemy will result in a point for the player.</p></center>
<center><h2> Prioritized List</h2></center>
    <center><p>- Moveable charcter</p></center>
    <center><p>- Genertaed Platfrom</p></center>
    <center><p>- Randomly Moving and spawning Enemies</p></center>
    <center><p>- Collision system to elimainate Enemies</p></center>
    <center><p> -Point system</p></center>


<center><h2>Future Additions</h2></center>
    <center><p>- Sprites</p></center>
    <center><p>- Evolving platforms</p></center>
    <center><p>- Enemy Projectiles</p></center>
    <center><p>- Switchable weapons</p></center>

<center><h2>Basic Technical Features</h2></center>
<center><p>I will be utilizing all the basic features of Python. This includes loops, functions, variables, and just about everything else we have used thus far in class</p></center> 
<center><h2>Advanced Technical Features</h2></center>
<center><p> The main advanced feature I will be utilizing is the PyGame library. I have already began to teach myself some aspects of it but it will interesti to figure out the more advanced elements that are possible with it. </p></center>
